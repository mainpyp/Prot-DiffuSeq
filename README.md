# LucidProts
If you was directed to this repostitory from the ISBC poster, then stay tuned. I did not yet find the time to update this README. 
In the meantime, have a look at the [model](https://huggingface.co/adrianhenkel/lucid-prots-model), the [tokenized dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/adrianhenkel/lucidprots_full_data) or the [tokenizer](https://huggingface.co/adrianhenkel/lucid-prot-tokenizer) used in this work.
