# FINAL GENERATION FOLDER

This folder contains all generations from the final training. 
Each checkpoint has its own directory containing a *json file*, a *recovered sequence fasta* file and a *reference sequence fasta* file for each seed.

Training runs from which we obtained the generations are marked with the _BACKUP_ suffix. They are not important but safe is safe.
